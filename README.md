# project-landing-page

<p> This is my second project from The Odin Project, 
is now the begining of august 2025, it's been since 
the end of may when i started to learn how to code.
Now i seem to have the foundations for HTML and CSS, 
i also improved my typing with a page called typing.com,
and improved some other areas in my way to make this a 
whole. I will be back here after i finish, 
to reflect a little about the project.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>So, the purpose of the project was to make a webpage from a design provided by
TOP, we needed to replicate the design and structure, they provided colors, font styles
and sizes and the general layout, but you had the option to do it with your own content, so that's what i did.It took me about 3 days to finish it. At the beginning it felt a little bit overwhelming, but once i started laying out the HTML i couldn't stop working on it and i enjoyed the assignment.</p>

<p>I find it really uplifting, like, i feel that in a span of three months i went from 0 skills to very basic and simple skills, but it is a lot of improvement you know? going from "hello world" to design a fake webpage, i like the feeling and i want to pursue it. </p>
