# project-landing-page

This is my second project from The Odin Project, 
is now the begining of august 2025, it's been since 
the end of may when i started to learn how to code.
Now i seem the have the foundations for HTML and CSS, 
i also improved my typing with a page called typing.com,
and improved some other areas in my way to make this a 
whole. I will be back here after i finish, 
to reflect a little about the project.
