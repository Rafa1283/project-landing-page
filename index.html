            telling me that maybe i can write something good, 
            something meaningful, something that resonates with people.
            I have always wished that
            i had the time (or the will), to do it. Now as a 
            Mexican expat living in Denmark, i have decided 
            to change careers from being a lawyer in my previous 
            life, to learn how to code. In my journey, i have 
            a project to deliver for my course, so i'm doing it,
             whether for fun or for myself, let's see how far 
            i can take it."
